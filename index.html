									Meet the Meridians! We can't wait to get married on our 11th anniversary and change our last name!

						<header><h3>About Our Wedding</h3></header>
						<p>
							Some things about our special day will seem a bit non-traditional, but we will still be wearing white! 
							Since we both identify as non-binary (neither male nor female) that means neither of us are a bride or groom! 
							We'd like to be known as spouses, the happy couple, partners, or life partners. 
							If you are tempted to say "bride" or "groom" please just use our first names instead. 
							Also, neither of us will use "Mr & Mrs" rather we are "Mx & Mx" before and after getting married (pronounced like mix.)
							When we get married, we are choosing a new family name "Meridian" in memory of the first street we lived on together. 
							We ask that you please do not buy us gifts with gendered words on them. If you'd like to get us something special, 
							feel free to print our new last name on any household item or use M as a monogram. 
							Again, we are so excited for all of our friends and family to join us in celebration. Thank you so much for understanding. 
							Feel free to reach out to either of us if you have questions around this.

						<header><h3>How we met from Alex's perspective</h3></header>
						<p>
							On the way out to the car one day in November 2011, 
							my neighbor Chelsea was walking by and let me know she was having a birthday party later that day and I should come by. 
							At the time, I really enjoyed trying to kiss everyone, so I spent most of the party asking people for that. 
							They all knew me already so it wasn't really that surprising for them. 
							Then someone I'd never seen before arrived. They were late, and everyone was complimenting them on their new haircut. 
							Of course, I asked them to kiss me, but they declined as most people would to a person they'd never met before. 
							Once the night was coming to an end, the only people left there were me, the birthday girl, and Mads. 
							Mads, feeling more confident now, looks at me and says "Okay, I'll kiss you." 
							So I go to kiss them, the same as I would anyone else, but they surprised me because, unlike most people, they kissed back. 
							More of a kiss than the person I was currently dating kissed me normally. 
							I was so shocked by it, I went to school and excitedly told all my friends about them. 
							To quote a song, 
							<figure>
								<blockquote>
									I fell in love from the moment we kissed<br/>
									Since then, we've been history
								</blockquote>

						<header><h3>How we got engaged from Mads's perspective</h3></header>
						<p>
							We were planning to attend the final "Emo Night" of 2019 at B Side Lounge in the Coventry neighborhood of Cleveland, 
							a theme night where they only play early 2000's alternative rock/emo/punk music (our favorite music!) 
							We had so many friends attending that we took two cars to get there. 
							On the way, I texted the other car that I was planning to propose to Alex. Everyone was so excited! 
							I said something like "Keep the secret but please have your phones out for pictures!" 
							Earlier in the day, I had contacted the DJ and asked them to play a special song at midnight, 
							and I printed out the lyrics to propose with: 
							<figure>
								<blockquote>
									I'm gonna make damn sure ...<br/>
									You won't ever get too far from me
								</blockquote>
								<figcaption>
									&mdash; <cite>MakeDamnSure</cite>
									by Taking Back Sunday
								</figcaption>
							</figure>
							The funny part is, the DJ was having technical difficulties with their microphone all night, 
							so the first thing everyone heard (besides music) was my proposal just after midnight! 
							I was a little drunk, but there is a great video of me saying 
							"You're my best friend, and it's going to be a new decade, will you spend more decades with me??" 
							before getting down on one knee and pulling out the lyrics to the song we just sang to each other. 
							Alex cried so much and shook their head yes! 
							Everyone cheered and it was such a special moment. 
							I'm so glad we had so many friends there to see this awesome moment in our lives together. 
							Now we are planning to have a live emo band at our wedding!
